**What aspect of this exercise did you find most interesting?**

The most fascination part of this coding exercise was crafting a Esri map solution for UAE car rentals. It allowed me to revisit and enhance my knowledge of Esri .NET and their SDK capabilities. The process of developing everything from scratch - from ideation, planning, class diagrams, and logic to coding, unit tests, and comprehensive testing - was both fulfilling and engaging. 

What added an extra layer of interest was the commitment to incorporating good design patterns, ensuring not only functionality but also a well-structured and efficient solution. Moreover, the emphasis on creating a design open for future extensions added a forward-thinking and innovative dimension to the entire exercise.



**What did you find most cumbersome?**

The toughest part of the coding exercise was dealing with the mapping in the Esri solution for UAE car rentals. Figuring out the right map view extents for the UAE region and using the correct coordinate system was a bit challenging. This led me to revisit and strengthen my understanding of coordinate systems in Spatial reference.

Additionally, implementing the mediator pattern along with a container and Dependency injection for WPF, all while incorporating the MVVM pattern, was a valuable learning experience. It required dedicated time to structure the project properly, ensuring flexibility for any future extensions. Then creating suitable test cases, mock data, and test scenarios for unit testing posed another learning curve.

As a developer, I consciously focused more on programming principles than creating a fancy UI. Designing the frontend look of the app was a challenge, so I opted for a very basic yet clean look and feel, prioritizing functionality over aesthetics.
